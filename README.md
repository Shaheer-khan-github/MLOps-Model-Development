# Learn Effective MLOps: Model Development

This repository contains materials from the Weights and Biases course [MLOps Course](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/effective-mlops-model-development)

Bringing machine learning models to production is challenging, with a continuous iterative lifecycle that consists of many complex components. 

Having a disciplined, flexible and collaborative process - an effective MLOps system - is crucial to enabling velocity and rigor, and building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that continually delivers production-ready ML models and services.
